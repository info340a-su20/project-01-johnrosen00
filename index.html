    <h2>Topic Domain</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>General Topic:</h3>
        Generally, I am interested in fitness. I love the feeling of having quantitative proof of self improvement.
        
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Problem Space:</h3>
        Physical fitness improves slowly. Over long periods of time, quantitative improvements to fitness are very noticeable. 
        In the short term, this is not the case. Many people get discouraged when they start going to the gym because they feel like 
        their hard work is not getting rewarded. Many people who work out a lot get discouraged after their improvements start plateauing.
        </p>

        
        <p>
        If improvements in fitness start stagnating, it is usually a sign that it is necessary to make some changes to your routine or diet. 
        Without a good way to record changes in fitness, it is harder to identify when you need to shake things up.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Existing Solutions:</h3>
        An obvious existing solution to this problem space is to write down what you did on a given day, and how well you did it. For instance,
        if you ran, you can write down how fast you ran and how far you ran. If you lifted, you could write down lift, rep range, weight.

        </p>
        <p>
        The issue with this solution is that its hard to make insights about self improvement long term, and paper is a medium that is
        easily damaged by water or sweat.
            
        </p>
        <p>
        Another existing solution to this problem space is fitness apps. Most fitness apps contain some degree of functionality that
        allows users to record information long term about their bodies or improvements on physical fitness. However, many of these
        apps are feature rich and bloated, such as
        <cite><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myfitnesspal/id341232718">MyFitnessPal</a></cite>.
         Many of them are focused on solely one type of workout or goal
        (eg weightloss vs improving cardiovascular strength vs gaining muscle mass), most of them
        try to help users make a routine, and many of them contain some sort of scheduling feature. 
        <cite><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.jamesgay.fitnotes&hl=en_US">Fitnote</a></cite>
         was the best fitness app I
        could find, and it was more or less only focused on weightlifting and require users to only input lifts that are in their database.
        An excessively feature rich fitness app lacks the elegance and clarity that a notebook has without being a meaningful improvement
        to pen and paper.
        </p>
    </p>

    <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
        The app I am proposing will record data about 2 things: cardio (biking, running, swimming) and weightlifting.
        The metrics I will record for cardio are: cardio type, time, and distance. For weightlifting I will record 
        lift type, set/rep range, weight. After a workout, the user will record data into this app. Over a long period of time,
        the app will make insights about their improvement. It will compare user improvement to projected average improvement,
        it will graph their improvement, and it will have the option of setting the timeframe for this analysis.
        </p> <p>
        Potentially, anybody who does cardio or lifts can use this app. However, it is probably most effectively used by people who know
        what they are doing with regards to lifting and running before using this app, as this app is not intended to give any fitness advice.
        People inexperienced with lifting or running are unlikely to use the information gleaned from this app as effectively as someone who is.
        </p>
        This app will address the problem space I presented by maintaining the simplicity and flexibility of pen and paper while adding
        a degree of insight that would be extremely difficult to get without the use of a computer.
